Example scripts to download and parse table of results from Middlebury and Alphamatting websites into a Pandas DataFrame, which can then be output as a LaTeX table.

Requires Python packages:

- pandas
- requests
- html5lib
- beautifulsoup4

If you are missing any of these, try installing with pip or conda (recommended). From a basic [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) installation you only need to add html5lib with `conda install html5lib`.

Pull requests welcome.
